# Hardcore Hearts Sound Pack

## What's this all about?
This is a Minecraft resource pack containing sounds featuring Twitch streamers in CarlCrafts' Hardcore Hearts Stream Team.

## Follow The Stream Team
* Catch their livestreams on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/team/hardcorehearts), and tell them Kuoxsr sent you.

## How to install
1. In Minecraft's main menu, click "Options"
2. Click "Resource Packs."
3. At the bottom of the screen that appears, click "Open Pack Folder."
4. Drop the zip file into this folder using your file manager and then return to Minecraft.  You should see the pack in the list at the left side of the screen (Available)
5. Click the arrow on the pack to move it to the right side of the screen (Selected)
6. Click "Done" and play the game.

## Technical notes
#### Sounds
All the sounds in this pack are fully normalized and game volume directives are specified in the sounds.json file, which makes changing the volume for a specific file much easier and can even be done by you, just by editing the zip file, if you think a particular sound is too loud.

#### Building from source
At any time, if you are impatient for a new version and you know what you are doing, you can clone my repository to your hard drive and pack the files yourself. I will not, however, be able to provide any kind of support for versions packed by other people.  There's just not enough time in the day for that.  Make sure you choose a name that doesn't match my format; perhaps use the word "custom" or the date you cloned the repo.

## Bug reports
Please report any bugs or issues or feature requests you have on the project's Github [issues](https://github.com/Kuoxsr/[specific_page_here]) page.

#### A suggestions format might look like the following

* Take a clip of a Twitch livestream during the moment of audio you think would make a nice event sound for this pack
* Open an [issue](https://github.com/Kuoxsr/[specific_page_here]) on the github page, describing the word or phrase from the clip that you'd like to see in the pack
* Include a link to the Twitch clip, and name the Minecraft event you think the clip would be good for.

## Currently featured in this pack:
* [JazzLikeOnion](https://www.twitch.tv/jazzlikeonion) - player hurt sounds (experimenting with Ghast and/or Enderman scream sounds in this version)
