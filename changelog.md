Probably still a "beta" because there are still very few sounds included, but "beta" scares people into thinking there's something dangerous about it.  I assure you this is not the case.  It's just a bunch of sounds.

Contains 16 total sounds from various members of the Hardcore Hearts Team, including:
##### [CarlCrafts](https://www.twitch.tv/carlcrafts)
Secret jump-scare
##### [JazzLikeOnion](https://www.twitch.tv/jazzlikeonion)
Player: fall damage
Villager: ambient, trade
Ghast: warn
Enderman: scream
##### [Tamildin](https://www.twitch.tv/tamildin)
Witch: ambient
Villager: hurt
##### [TheBakedDean](https://www.twitch.tv/thebakeddean)
Villager: death, hurt

Monsters no longer make the oof" sound when falling from a height

Initial release

Really an "alpha" version that was released only to [JazzLikeOnion](https://www.twitch.tv/jazzlikeonion), since his "death clip" sounds were the only sounds in the pack at the time.

I included four files:

1. Light fall damage (uhh)
2. Heavy fall damage (ughh)
3. Enderman scream (highly processed)
4. Ghast scream (even more highly processed)
